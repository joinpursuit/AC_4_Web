## Interviewer A Questions

**Directions**: Below are the questions you will ask your partner. For each question, evaluate your partner's performance using the rubric. Record your feedback below each question and share it with your partner. You can fork this and submit the repo link when you are done **or** you can just copy and paste the questions/feedback.

I am:

My partner is:

* Describe a challenge you've had at work. What was it, and how did you address it?
  * Feedback:

* We have an array, and we'd like to know if it contains any triples - that is, an integer that appears three times in a row. Write a function that returns `true` if the array contains a triple.
  * **Clarifying, if they ask**: the array contains only integers. The array is not sorted. The array can contain any number of triples - return true if it contains at least one.*
  * Feedback:

* Given a string, take the last character and return a new string with the last character added at the front and back, so "cat" yields "tcatt".
  * **If they ask**: The original string will be length 1 or more.*
  * Feedback:
